## Reading a Scientific Article

- What is a scientific article?

- How do you read a scientific article?

- Activity

- Discussion of article

## What is a scientific article on politics?

- A scientific article on politics is a report of original research 
- It is published in a peer-reviewed journal

        - Peer review is not replication
        - Peer review is intended to ensure that the research is sound, the article is well-written, and that it contributes in an interesting way to the progress of the discipline
        - Peer review is sometimes biased, but double blind and multiple reviewers are the standard to minimize bias

- It is written by a political scientist for other political scientists

        - This does not mean it was written by someone with an advanced degree in political science
        - Peer review is blind to credentials
        

## How do you read a scientific article?

- Read the abstract
- Read the conclusion
- Read the introduction
- Read the literature review selectively
- Read the theory
- Read the research design
- Read the results
- Read the conclusion again

## What are you looking for?

- What is the research question? The puzzle
- What is the contribution to the literature?
- what is the theory?
- What is the research design?
- What are the main findings?


## Research question

- What is the puzzle?
- what is the outcome the author is trying to explain? (dependent variable, DV, Y variable)
- This should be early in the abstract and the introduction

## What is the contribution to the literature?

- What is the current state of the literature? 
- What does the author take as settled?
- What is the current debate this is intended to address?
- Does the author offer a new theory, new data, or a new method?

## What is the theory?

- What are the dependent variables (DVs, Y variables)?
- What are the independent variables (IVs, X variables)?
- What are the testable, falsifiable hypotheses?
- Are there any mediating or moderating variables? Any conditions?

## What is the research design?

- What is the unit of analysis?
- What is the scope? (Time, geogrpahy, population of interest, etc.)
- What is the method of data collection?
- What is the method of data analysis?
        
## Results

- What are the main results?
- What are the main tables and figures? 
- Significance and effect sizes
- Is the theory confirmed or disconfirmed?
        
## Conclusion and discussion

- What are the main findings? What is unresolved?
- What are the implications for the literature?
- What are the implications for policy?
- What are the implications for future research?
