# Measurement, Validity, and Reliability in Political Inquiry

## The Strategic Imperative of Measurement

* **The Harsh Truth**
    * Political arguments only as robust as supporting data.
    * Measurement = Strategic bridge between "Theoretical Plane" (ideas) and "Empirical Plane" (reality).
    * Without measurement, political science reduces to philosophy.
    
    
## From Theory to Observation: The "So What?"

* **Defining the Battlefield:** Moves theory into the realm of falsifiability; unmeasurable theories are unscientific.

* **Rejection of Subjectivity:** Shifts from personal "conceptions" to "inter-subjective" agreement (e.g., agreeing on visible indicators of Democracy).

* **Precision and Replicability:** Standardization allows independent verification across time and space.

* *Goal:* Mastery of mental discipline before application of statistical tools.

## From "Fuzzy" Ideas to Concrete Constructs

* **The "Original Sin" of Research**

    * Failure to define terms (e.g., Democracy, Power) leading to ambiguity.

    * **Conceptualization:** Defining abstract/fuzzy ideas in precise terms.
    
## The "Scientific Lie": Making Abstractions Concrete

* **Reification**

        * Treating mental abstractions (constructs) as if they were real, tangible objects.
   
         * A "scientific lie" necessary for measurement.
         
* *The Risk:* Flawed conceptualization leads to studying illusions.
    
## The Anatomy of a Construct

* **Unidimensional:** Single underlying scale (e.g., Weight). 

        *Risk:* Oversimplification (e.g., treating Self-Esteem as single-faceted).

* **Multidimensional:** Multiple underlying dimensions (e.g., Academic Aptitude = Math + Verbal). 

        *Risk:* Measurement error if dimensions are ignored.
     
## Operationalization and Measurement Scales

* **Operationalization:** The blueprint for data collection; dictates statistical handling.

## The Four Levels of Measurement

* **Nominal (Categorical):** Mutually exclusive labels; no order. (e.g., Regime Type). *Stats:* Mode, Chi-square.

* **Ordinal:** Rank-ordered; unknown distance between ranks. (e.g., Political Activism). *Stats:* Median, Percentiles.

* **Interval:** Rank-ordered + equidistant; arbitrary zero. (e.g., IQ Scores). *Stats:* Correlation, Regression (often applied to Likert).

* **Ratio:** Interval qualities + true zero. (e.g., Military Spending). *Stats:* All permissible.

## Measurement Strategies for Constructs

* * **Scale Strategy for surveys**

* **Likert Scales:** Intensity of agreement; technically ordinal but often treated as interval for regression.

* **Guttman Scales:** Cumulative intensity; hierarchy of engagement (High intensity agreement implies low intensity agreement).

## Examples: Likert Scale Question

* "To what extent do you agree with the following statement: 'Democracy is the best form of government.'"

    * Strongly Disagree
    * Disagree
    * Neutral
    * Agree
    * Strongly Agree


## Example: Guttman Scale Questions

* "Have you ever participated in the following political activities?"

    1. Voted in a general election
    2. Voted in a primary election
    3. Signed a petition
    4. Attended a political rally
    5. Volunteered for a campaign
    6. Donated money to a political cause
    7. Run for public office

## 4. The Yardsticks of Scientific Rigor

* **Standardization:** The defense against biased observation.

* **The Shooting Target Analogy**

    * **Reliability (Consistency):** Hitting the same spot repeatedly (even if off-center).
    * **Validity (Accuracy):** Hitting the bullseye; measuring what is claimed.

## Evaluating Validity (The Pillars)

* **Internal Validity:** Establishing causality vs. spurious correlations.

* **External Validity:** Generalizability to broader populations 

* **Construct Validity:** Ensuring the tool measures the actual concept 

* **Statistical Conclusion Validity:** Appropriate use of mathematical tests for the data type


# Application & Discussion: Kahan & Corbin (2016)

## The Anatomy of the Study: Variables & Hypotheses

* **The Baseline Check**
    * What is the **Dependent Variable (DV)** in this study? (What is being explained?)
    * What is the **Independent Variable (IV)**? (What is doing the explaining?)
    * *Hint:* Look at the title. "Actively Open-Minded Thinking" (AOT) vs. "Polarization."


## The Theory vs. The Hypothesis

* **Theory:** What does the literature suggest *should* happen when people think more critically?

    * **Hypothesis:** If AOT measures "neutrality," what should the slope look like?
    
    * **The Result:** What actually happened? (The "Perverse Effect").
     

## Critiquing the Construct: Measuring "Open-Mindedness"

* **Conceptualization Challenge**
    * How do you measure a thought process?
    * Kahan & Corbin use the "Actively Open-Minded Thinking" (AOT) scale.
    * *Class Discussion:* Is this scale measuring a *willingness* to change one's mind, or a *capacity* to argue better?
    
* **Validity Check**
    * **Face Validity:** Do the questions ostensibly look like they measure open-mindedness?
    * **Construct Validity:** If AOT correlates with *higher* polarization, is the measure invalid?
    
## Thought Question

* *Provocation:* If a thermometer showed water freezing at 100°C, would you blame the water or the thermometer? (Apply this logic to the AOT scale).


## Operationalizing "Polarization"

* **Defining the Term**
    * Is "Polarization" a behavior (shouting/protesting) or a mental state (belief divergence)?
    
* How do the authors measure polarization?

## Measurement Strategy

* * The authors measure polarization via "Climate Change Risk Perception."
    
    * *Critique:* Is "Risk Perception" a valid proxy for "Political Polarization"? Why or why not?
    
    * *Alternative Measures:* How else could we measure polarization?
        * Voting records? (Nominal)
        * Affective Thermometer ratings of the other party? (Interval/Ratio)
    

## The Validity Paradox: Instrumental vs. Intrinsic
* **The "So What?" for Political Science**
    * The study shows that high AOT scores + Partisanship = *Maximum* Polarization.
* **Re-evaluating the Construct**
    * Does this mean the AOT scale has **Low Validity** (it failed to predict open-mindedness)?
    * OR... does it mean our **Theory** of open-mindedness was wrong?


## Discussion

* What else could AOT be measuring besides open mindedness?

* **Cognitive Sophistication:** the ammunition used to defend the tribe, not a willingness to abandon it
* **Motivated Reasoning:** Ability to rationalize pre-existing beliefs more effectively



## Internal Validity Threat

* **Spurious Correlation Risk**
    * Could a "Third Variable" be driving these results? (e.g., Education, Income, Media Consumption).

## Transferring the Logic: Measuring "Democracy"
* **From Micro (Individuals) to Macro (Regimes)**
    * If measuring "Open-Mindedness" is this hard, how do we measure "Democracy"?
    
    
## Conceptualization Exercise

* **Binary Strategy:** Is Democracy a switch? (Democracy vs. Autocracy).

* **Continuous Strategy:** Is Democracy a spectrum? (Polity IV score -10 to +10).

* **Operationalization Trade-offs**
    * If you include "Economic Equality" in your measure of Democracy, what happens?
    * *Risk:* You can no longer test if "Democracy causes Wealth" because you have built wealth *into* the definition of Democracy. (Tautology).






## Wrap-Up and Final Takeaways

* **Integrity of Discipline:** Relies on transparency and rigor of measurement.

* **Statistical Complexity:** Cannot salvage poor conceptual design.

* **The Four Pillars of Scientific Method**

    * **Replicability:** Independent repetition must yield similar results.
    * **Precision:** Exact definitions allowing universal application.
    * **Falsifiability:** Theories must be capable of being disproven.
    * **Parsimony (Occam’s Razor):** The simplest explanation is superior.
